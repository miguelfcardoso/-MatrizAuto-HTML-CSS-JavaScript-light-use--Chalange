# 🚗 MatrizAuto – HTML / CSS Challenge

A frontend landing page / UI project built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** (light use) — part of a styling / layout challenge.

---

## 🧩 Project Overview

This repository showcases a responsive, visually rich layout for **MatrizAuto**, a car shopping / auto-related interface.  
The goal was to replicate a design (images, layout, responsive behavior) using only HTML, CSS, and minimal JS for interactivity.

Key aspects:
- Pixel-perfect layout (or as close as possible)  
- Responsive design (desktop / mobile)  
- Visual components: header, menu, carousels, images, footers  
- Basic interactivity (menu toggles, etc.)

## 📂 Repository Structure

| File / Folder | Purpose |
|----------------|---------|
| `index.html.html` | Main HTML file (landing page) |
| `estilos.css` | CSS stylesheet with layout, styles, responsive rules |
| `logica.js` | JavaScript logic (e.g. menu toggling or small interactions) |
| Images / SVGs (`*.png`, `*.svg`, etc.) | Visual assets (logo, car images, background, icons) |
| Other assets | Icons, social media graphics, etc. |

## 🎨 Technologies & Tools

- **HTML5**  
- **CSS3** (Flexbox, Grid, media queries)  
- **JavaScript** (for minimal interactive behavior)  
- **Responsive design principles**

## 📱 Responsive Behavior

- Layout adapts to mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints  
- Menu toggles (hamburger icon) on smaller screens  
- Images scale / crop appropriately  
- Navigation / footer remain usable on all screen sizes
